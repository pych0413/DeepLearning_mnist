# Image Classification (MNIST)
Training the high accuracy image classification model by using the mnist data.
<br>
<br>
It has different image classification model inside the jupyter notebooks.
Different model train by different hyper parameter such as the structure of hidden layer, optimizer, learning rate, batch size and epochs.
<br>
## Result
In [NeuralNetwork_mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/pych0413/mnist_ImageClassification/blob/master/NeuralNetwork_mnist.ipynb), the best simplistic Neural Network model has 98.21% testing accuracy.
<br>
In [CNN_mnist.ipynb](https://github.com/pych0413/mnist_ImageClassification/blob/master/CNN_mnist.ipynb), the best CNN model has 99.35% testing accuracy.
